# How to Configure RAM Permissions for Game Shield? {#task_i11_zrf_xdb .task}

Game Shield supports the division of permissions through the RAM system. The specific steps are as follows:

1.   See [Create  RAM user](../../SP_65/DNRAM11815774/ZH-CN_TP_12340.dita) to create and configure RAM accounts. 
2.   Assign Game Shield’s related permissions. 

    Currently, the following two permissions are supported:

    -   Manage Game Shield’s full operation permission: AliyunYundunGameShieldFullAccess
    -   Manage Game Shield’s read-only access permission: AliyunYundunGameShieldReadOnlyAccess

# How to configure RAM permissions for Game Shield {#task_i11_zrf_xdb .task}

Game Shield supports the division of permissions through the RAM system. The specific steps are as follows.

1.  See [Create a RAM user](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM users/Create a RAM user.md#) to create and configure RAM accounts.
2.  Assign Game Shield’s related permissions. 

    Currently, the following two permissions are supported:

    -   Manage Game Shield’s full operation permission: AliyunYundunGameShieldFullAccess
    -   Manage Game Shield’s read-only access permission: AliyunYundunGameShieldReadOnlyAccess

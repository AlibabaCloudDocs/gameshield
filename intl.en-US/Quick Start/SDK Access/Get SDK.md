2.   Locate a game that has been added, click **Download SDK**, select the applicable operating system, and download the SDK package. 

    **Note:** 

    -   The default testable version provided is the SDK1.0.0. This version can be debugged, but does not provide high-strength encryption.
    -   The official version can be obtained by contacting the Game Shield team after the SDK is activated. Each user gets a customized encrypted version.
    -   The Game Shield SDK after version 5.2.5 is docked through [SDK encrypted tunnel](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Encrypted Tunnel Mode.md#), which can solve protocol stimulation-based connection flood attacks.

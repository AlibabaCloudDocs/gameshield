# Step 5: Complete Access {#concept_ogn_1m2_xdb .concept}

Game Shield offers two access methods:

-   CNAME access
-   SDK access \(recommended\)

## CNAME Access {#section_gqz_bm2_xdb .section}

The group name obtained in step four is a scheduling CNAME. You can complete the access of Game Shield by resolving the service domain name to this CNAME address.

**Note:** 1. When large DDoS attacks cause intra-group IP switchover, the CNAME scheduling time is usually over 10 minutes, and is uncontrollable due to the influence of the carrier's DNS cache.

## SDK Access {#section_iqz_bm2_xdb .section}

SDK scheduling occurs at the second-level and has the functions of link detection and smart scheduling.

For SDK access guide, see the corresponding SDK access documents.

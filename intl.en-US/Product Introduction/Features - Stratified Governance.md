Stratified governance is the basis for solving these problems. Inequality of any resource is derived from the fact that a target is too easy found by the attacker, and the defender is too easy of a target.

The “layer by layer” manner in governance represents the splitting of traffic, the splitting of services, and the splitting of targets, which increases the costs and thresholds for attackers and minimizes the costs for users. “Layer” represents a kind of funnel model.  In the past, we used bandwidth to combat DDoS attacks. In Game Shield, we use the most suitable ‘weapons’ for what they are best at.

-   **User layer \(SDK\)**: The data at the user level is always less trustworthy. As the initiator of communications, protecting yourself is a top priority.
-   **Network layer \(Selb\)**: Leave network concerns to the dedicated network devices, rather than solely relying on the server way.
-   **Access layer \(Game Security Gateway\)**: Do you still remember the impact of connection flood attacks? The access layer is prepared to defense them. At this layer, only user behavior is processed; businesses are not processed.
-   Service layer: The real business server must be well protected and cannot be directly exposed. Isolation of physical paths is a relatively good choice.

Game Shield has changed the traditional method of defending against DDoS attacks where it becomes a battle of bandwidth and is a comprehensive risk control solution for the gaming industry. Under the risk control theory of Game Shield, if we solve the problem on the user side, we can defend against DDoS attacks of any size, thus achieving the balance of attack and defense costs.

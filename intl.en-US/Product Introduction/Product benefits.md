|Comparison Items|Game Shield|Traditional DDoS Traffic Cleansing Data Centers|
|:---------------|:----------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Massive DDoS attacks on the gaming industry|Gets away from arms race of DDoS attack and defense, professionally defending massive DDoS attacks on the gaming industry .Â  Distributed anti-DDoS nodes . High-quality BGP access to provide a highly available network environment for games.|Only relies on one local data center, and bandwidth is not expandable, making it unable to defend against larger DDoS attacks.|
|Fingerprint encryption/link encryption|Supports TCP/HTTP/HTTPS . Suitable for all kinds of service scenarios, such as mobile games, client games, and so on . Supports in-cloud/out-of-cloud client. Integration game SDK. Full-link encryption for data packets, and anti-cracking. End-to-end encryption for security access of games. Supports protection against attacks on simulated game protocols. Supports decoding for proprietary game protocols. Supports real-time adjustment of protection algorithms.|The traditional data center cleanning replies on hardware devices for identification and cannot decode proprietary game protocols.|
|Supports decoding proprietary game protocols|DPI \(deep packet inspection\) technology, automatically establishes protocol features through machine learning, and only releases requests that meet the protocol features.|The traditional data center cleanning replies on hardware devices for identification and cannot decode proprietary game protocols.|
|Custom game protection algorithm|Defends against empty connections, slow connections, malicious kicker attacks, global botnet repository, and SHIELD attack tracing for games.|Most traditional data centers use firewall devices or hardware devices, making the update of defense algorithms slow and the data centers do not have the ability to adjust the defense algorithms.|

**Note:** HTTP flood protection support for the HTTP/HTTPS protocol is provided by the Web Application Firewall product, which is purchased separately.
